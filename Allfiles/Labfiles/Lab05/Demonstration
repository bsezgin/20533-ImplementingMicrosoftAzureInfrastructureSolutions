**Demonstration Steps**

1.  In the Azure portal, create a new mobile app by specifying a unique valid URL, 
    a new resource group named **20533D0502-DemoRG**, and the existing AdatumAppServicePlan App Service plan. 
    Do not enable Application Insights.

2.  In the Azure portal, navigate to the newly created mobile app. 
    Open the Quickstart blade, choose Windows (C#) as the language for the business logic code,
    and then click the Connect a database section.
    
3.  Add a data connection with the connection string MS_TableConnectionString to a new SQL Database named AdatumMobileDB. 
    Set the pricing tier of the database to S0 Standard,
    configure the corresponding Microsoft SQL Server instance 
    with the admin user Instructor and the password Pa55w.rd, and then deploy it to the same location as the mobile app.
    
4.  On the Windows (C#) blade, under the Create a table API section, select C# as the back-end language.

5.  Click the Download link, and then save the compressed files on your computer. 
    These files contain the startup project that you can open in Visual Studio, develop the code, and then publish to Azure.
